1. API Aggregation and Enhancement:
Use OpenParliament API: Start by fetching the available bill information from the OpenParliament API.
Enhance Data: Since OpenParliament provides only basic details with legal jargon, you could enhance this data by:
    - scrape the .json for a sample set of bills from parl.ca
<!-- Manual Curation: For a select number of bills, manually curate additional information like "Pros", "Cons", etc. This would not be scalable but could serve as a demonstration of the app's capabilities. -->
Automated Summarization: Use a text summarization API or build a simple GPT-based model to translate legal jargon into simple English.

2. Database Integration:
Store the enhanced bill data in a database. This allows you to:
    - Cache the data fetched from OpenParliament.
    - Store additional information you've curated or generated.
    - Database Choice: Use a NoSQL database like MongoDB if your data structure is more JSON-like, or a SQL database if you need relational data structuring.

3. React Client-Side Application:
Interactive UI: Create an interface where users can browse through bills.
Data Visualization: Implement features like search, filter, and categorize bills.
Detail View: On selecting a bill, present detailed information in an easily digestible format.
