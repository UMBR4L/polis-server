## Set-Up Development Environment

### Create a new project repository on GitHub

- [ ] Create a new repository on your GitHub account.
- [ ] Choose a meaningful name for your project.
- [ ] Add a brief description of your project.
- [ ] Configure the repository as public or private, depending on your preferences.

### Configure your IDE

- [ ] Install and set up the Integrated Development Environment (IDE) of your choice for JavaScript/Node.js development. Popular options include Visual Studio Code, WebStorm, or others.
- [ ] Configure any extensions or plugins that will enhance your development experience.

### Set up version control

- [ ] Initialize Git in your project folder if it's not already initialized.
- [ ] Create a .gitignore file to specify which files and directories should be excluded from version control. Common entries include node_modules, build files, and IDE-specific files.
- [ ] Make your initial commit to Git with the necessary project files.

### Project structure

- [ ] Organize your project directory structure. Common directories include "src" for source code, "public" for static assets, and "docs" for documentation.
- [ ] Create any necessary configuration files, such as package.json for Node.js project dependencies.

### Install node_modules

- [ ] Once your project repository is set up, and you have a basic project structure in place, you can install node_modules by running `npm install` or `yarn install`. This step is typically done after your project's initial setup.
