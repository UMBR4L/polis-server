## GPT Integration and Database Handling

In this phase of the project, we will focus on integrating a custom GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) model for enhancing bill details and efficiently handling database operations to store and retrieve enhanced responses. The goal is to provide users with comprehensive and understandable bill information while optimizing performance by caching enhanced responses.

### Task Breakdown

- [ ] **Day 1: GPT Integration**
  - [ ] **Setup Custom GPT Server or API**
    - [ ] Choose an appropriate GPT model (e.g., GPT-3.5 or a similar version).
    - [ ] Configure security measures to protect the GPT server from unauthorized access.
    - [ ] Implement API endpoints for communication with the GPT model.

  - [ ] **Backend Communication with GPT Server**
    - [ ] Establish a secure connection between the backend and the GPT server using authentication tokens or keys.
    - [ ] Define a function to send bill data to the GPT server and await the enhanced response.

  - [ ] **Error Handling for GPT Integration**
    - [ ] Set up error handling middleware to capture and handle errors during GPT requests.
    - [ ] Create informative error messages for various scenarios, such as GPT server unavailability or timeouts.

- [ ] **Day 2: Database Handling for Enhanced Responses**
  - [ ] **Design Database Schema**
    - [ ] Define the structure of the database tables, including fields like bill ID, enhanced description, date created, and date updated.
    - [ ] Choose an appropriate database system (e.g., MongoDB, PostgreSQL, or MySQL).

  - [ ] **Database Connection and CRUD Operations**
    - [ ] Establish a connection to the selected database.
    - [ ] Create functions to store enhanced bill responses in the database.
    - [ ] Develop functions for retrieving enhanced responses based on bill IDs.

  - [ ] **Integrate Database Handling with Bill Details Retrieval Process**
    - [ ] Modify the bill details retrieval logic to check if an enhanced response exists in the database.
    - [ ] If an enhanced response is found, return it directly instead of making an additional GPT request.
    - [ ] If no enhanced response exists, proceed with the GPT request, store the response in the database, and return it to the frontend.

  - [ ] **Error Handling for Database Operations**
    - [ ] Set up error handling mechanisms for database connection issues, data retrieval errors, and data insertion failures.
    - [ ] Create informative error messages and status codes for database-related errors.

### Expected Outcomes

By the end of this phase, we expect to have a robust GPT integration in place, allowing us to enhance bill details with clear and concise descriptions. Additionally, the database handling system will efficiently store and retrieve enhanced responses, optimizing performance and ensuring a seamless user experience in the Polis web application.
